                        <p>GT (game-tournaments.com) â€“ eSports project about the most popular PC games. At this
                            point of time Dota 2 and CS:GO are the main verticals presented on the site. Other
                            games should be coming soon.</p>


                        <p><a href="/">BetBoom Team</a> inactive carry <a href="/">Ivan "Pure~" Moskalenko</a>
                            mentioned he would play for a non-EEU Dota 2 team next season. On a recent stream,
                            he said he "is not in CIS, of course." It sounded like a deliberate mistake to hype
                            up his transfer, but could be a slip of the tongue as well.</p>

                                he's right on the spot. Then me, of course. Well, I'm no longer in the CIS, of
                                course... Oh, shit... Then Gleb [<a href="/">Kiyotaka</a>], Romanych [<a

                                everyone is ranked 500, and I'm ranked 100. And now, I'll turn off the stream so
                                that there is no VOD left.</p>

                        <p>Rumor has it Pure~ might end up in <a href="/">Tundra Esports</a>, initially reported
                            by the editor of Metaratings.ru. On January 8, Tundra revealed <a
                                href="/">MinD_ContRoL</a>'s addition. If the information about the Russian turns
                            out true, he will play in his original carry role.</p>
                        <p>Pure~ spent most of last year in offlane, as they swapped positions with <a
                                href="/">Nightfall</a> after <a href="/">Berlin Major.</a> He went inactive on
                            December 24. The official reason was to take care of his health and have a break
                            from professional Dota. BetBoom Team hasn't revealed his replacement yet.</p>
